Issues, pull requests, feedback all accepted and welcome.

Development workflow
====================

[poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) is used to manage dependencies and building wheels.

NOTE: Pyborg 2.0 will be python 3+ only!


Tips
====

If you break the brain format we have to do a "minor" version bump (e.g. 1.1->1.2).

Feature branches are encouraged but not required.
